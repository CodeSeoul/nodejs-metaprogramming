# Design a REST API

This repository is a brief example of building a basic REST API. We use NodeJS and Koa along with some common Koa middlewares to accomplish this. If you're not familiar with Koa, you can reference the project created from our previous lesson, [Build an API Server using NodeJS and Koa](https://github.com/CodeSeoul/api-node-koa).

## Supporting Materials
TBD

## How to Run
* Use `npm run start` to run the Koa server
